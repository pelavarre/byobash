"""
usage: touch.py [--h] [FILE ...]

stamp Files with date/time, to bring them to the end of the 'ls -1rt'

positional arguments:
  FILE    a File or Dir to trash (default: the last of the 'ls -1rt')

options:
  --help  show this help message and exit

quirks:
  goes well with:  cp.py, ls.py, mv.py, rm.py, rmdir.py
  classic Touch rudely declines to create a new file, when given no FILE name for it

examples:

  touch.py  # show these examples and exit
  touch.py --h  # show this help message and exit
  touch.py --  # todo: run as you like it

  touch.py  # call Rm Touch with no args to show these examples
  touch.py --  # stamp the second-to-last of 'ls -1rt' to make it last
  ls.py  # the 'ls -C' view of:  ls -1rt |tail -3
