r"""
usage: clear.py [--h] [-x]

wipe the Screen, delete the Scrollback, and leave the Cursor at Top Left

options:
  --help  show this help message and exit
  -x      actually don't delete the Scrollback, just scroll the Rows on Screen into it

quirks:

  works in Mac & Linux  # but FIXME: 'clear.py -x' at Linux/GShell
  goes well with: echo.py, reset.py, tput.py

  Linux 'clear -x' loses the Rows on Screen, doesn't scroll them into Scrollback
  Linux 'clear' says 3J H 2J in place of H 2 J 3J, so doesn't delete all Scrollback
  Linux 'clear && clear' says 3J H 2J 3J H 2J, to wipe Scrollback without deleting it

  GShell 'clear' goes wrong the same as Linux

  classic Clear rudely defaults to show no new output, when given no Parms

examples:

  clear.py  # show these examples and exit
  clear.py --h  # show this help message and exit
  clear.py --  # clear Terminal history, like ⌘K
  qbin/cls  # clear Terminal history, like ⌘K

  clear.py -x  # scroll the Rows on Screen, like ⌃L

  echo -ne '\e[H\e[2J\e[3J'  # clear Terminal History, like ⌘K
  echo -ne '\e[H\e[2J'  # scroll the Rows on Screen, like ⌃L
  echo -ne '\e[8;50;89t'  # change to 50 Rows x 89 Columns
  tput clear  # alt Clear
  reset  # alt Clear, commonly includes a 1s sleep

  echo && seq 40 && echo && seq 50 && echo && seq 60 && echo  # fill Screens for test
  clear 2>&1 |tee >(hexdump -C)  # call and trace Clear
  tput clear 2>&1 |tee >(hexdump -C)  # call and trace TPut Clear

  diff -u <(clear |hexdump -C) <(tput clear |hexdump -C)  # show no diff
