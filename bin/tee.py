r"""
usage: tee.py [--h] [-a] [FILE ...]

read from Stdin and write the bytes read into each File in order

positional arguments:
  FILE    the file to drop trailing lines from (default: stdin)

options:
  --help  show this help message and exit
  -a      append to the Files that already exist, don't create those

quirks:
  goes well with:  head.py, sed.py, tail.py
  classic Tee rudely hangs with no prompt, when given no Parms with no Stdin

examples:

  tee.py  # show these examples and exit
  tee.py --h  # show this help message and exit
  tee.py --  # todo: run as you like it

  echo {A..Z} |tr ' ' '\n' | tee >(head -2) >(sleep 0; tail -3) > /dev/null
