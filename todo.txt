compressed output from Git Fetch - just a few lines
tell me top hash added, and above base


Bash history by Dir


qg:  default to search the least common prefix of:  qno


g, qg:  grep to paragraphs, led by path, with hints indented

qlv:  call for one more line, but chop it down to decorations, else .

shelver.py - built out of Python's:  import shelf
from shelver import requests
from shelver import subprocess
run the same as standard Python, but quick from cache, till next:  rm -fr __pycache__/

--e, --ext=.py3:  if OPT["1"] or OPT["--oneword"]:  # 'ls -1', 'ls --oneword'

git.py:  charge more friction for pushes out of the domain, such as
git.py:     from 'git config user.email' 'work-for-hire.com'
git.py:     into 'github.com' at 'git remote -v'

v.py:  become my bottom-of-Terminal editor of Os Copy/Paste Buffer
v.py:  refetch on wake and between every key and poll - such as a ping/pong back thread
v.py:  resize the window for me, e.g. snap to 89 columns

v.py:  rewrite so as to keep Search Highlights correct after edits

v.py:  highlight to trail movement after M M until ' M
v.py:  counter of }{ paragraphs since M M

which.py:  list the conflicts in Sh Path, especially conflicts with ByoBash

faster fanout of 'git push' to multiple hosts

teach 'make style' to complain about leftover 'pdb.set_trace()' breakpoints

'qb/c' - calmer KeyboardInterrupt, and a full set of editing keystrokes

add cat.py, expand.py, vs Mac 'Illegal byte sequence's

adopt 'byo.stderr_print',
    across the files of 'import byotools as byo',
        in place of 'sys.stderr.write'

FIXME factor out a non-executable bin/pythonx.py, call it from python{3,2,}.py
FIXME Bash of Zsh: echo -ne '\e[8;50;89t'
FIXME the "  &&: # '", in place of "  &&: ", at such as:  ssh.py  &&:  # 'show these...
FIXME scroll-preserving clear is write empty lines for the rows, then destructive clear

implement the rest of the most prominently Helped Examples
    cp.py
    mv.py
    ...

solve 'qb/p'

Tab Completion in such places as:  mv -i *.
Tab Completion shouldn't require startswith, should care about history freq & recent

byo.exit_via_shpath_shverb:
forward down the Path
    resolve the Path to give only first seen of each Real Path
        while dropping the absence of Real Path
    then find Self exactly once
        and forward to the Next After Self
pass through to next .py in the Sh Path chain
    and then to the next without Ext in the Sh Path chain
        except fall back to first of chain when self Not found

form my own ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, from parts, as part of:  make push

easy grep of just dot configuration, without also picking up dot histoy


++ dreaming since Jun/2022 ++

ship 'README.py', not just 'README.md'

collapse '  # ' to '  # ' only when leading '  '  both present
    or some other way of remembering to insert both '  '


++ dreaming since May/2022 ++

ship better Arg Doc first
then drop better code into .py --python3
then run it at .py

'shopt autocd' could take '/dev/null' as 'cat - >/dev/null'
'shopt autocd' could take '/dev/zero' as infinite Cpu 'cat /dev/zero |hexdump -C'


++ earlier thoughts ++

work more at

    clear.py sleep.py stty.py uptime.py watch.py

fill out tab-completion, such as recent host names for Ssh
